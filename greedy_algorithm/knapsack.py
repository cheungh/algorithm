    algorithm
    1. read items to be loot
    2. sort items in reverse order
        most valuable on the left
    3. iterate from 0 to len(n)
    4. check if there is room to put item in knapsack

            (b) subtract knapsack capacity from current item weight
    6. No:  (a) No room, break
            (b) some room, but not enough: put remaining capacity of current item into knapsack
